            <p>Hello my name is Javier Barajas. I thank you for taking the time to look at my biography for what I have done in Computer science for the years 2023-2024. I've enjoyed this class very much and have spent hours on making sure all my work would come out well. I encourage you to look at the other pages I made since I put in a lot of work into each assignment.</p>

                <p>At an early life I always enjoyed creating things. It could be small things like origami or tinkering with what was in the office drawers but I loved the feeling of bringing something that (at the time) I thought was helpful. I kept thinking and creating and for a big portion of my life I had this dream of being a scientist. I thought it was like being an alchemist creating chemical reactions. Then I found out it wasn't for me. All these experiments seemed boring when I found out how tedious they were. Then I went into junior high school and won a mouse cart racing competition for my steam class. It gave me that feeling of creating, and I wanted to become an engineer. I didn't just want to make basic machines. I now wanted to do robotics, and computer science became a stepping stone to that goal.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        This page discusses what I want to do in the future, what I have done in the past and what I am doing now for my education.
    </p>
    <h1>Educational Journey</h1>
    <p>
        I went to Edison elementary and learned the basics of math, reading/writing, and science (nothing special). I then moved onto junior high where I did robots for two years.
        I got principles honor rolls multiples times in a row and maintained a good GPA.
        I moved up again to high school and took intro to computer science freshman year.
        I kept trying to work hard in school and remained on the honor track for math and science while trying to make sure my GPA didn't free fall.
        Then I took a break by taking guitar my sophomore year after all the burn out and am now doing AP computer science my junior year.
        I attend Anaheim High School and am currently working at finishing the computer science course here.

    <h1>College and University Plans</h1>
    <p>
        When I graduate High school I plan to go to Stanford as my first option, UCLA as my second, and UCI as my third option. I want to do computer science in all of these schools and go wait a bit to see which jobs are the best.
    </p>
    <h1>Career Aspirations</h1>
    <p>
        I want to become either an engineer or software developer but I do know I want to work in robotics and create machines. I want to help the world advance technologically. The world is going through a
        technological boom and I want to be a hand that shapes this Neo industrial revolution. Computer science is also a safe career since virtually every job wants someone who can work with computers.
    </p>
    <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    <p>
        I intend to make robots that do mundane tasks like cleaning or help with construction. It seems small but these things can add up and allow people to do more important jobs.
